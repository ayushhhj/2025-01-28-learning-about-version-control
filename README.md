Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

## My Opinions on Version Control
- What I like most: When you learn how to use it effectively, it makes collaboration and version history super easy. 
- What I find challenging: Hate dealing with merge conflicts. I also think github makes things a little complicated unneccessarily, which makes it dificult to get good at initially.
